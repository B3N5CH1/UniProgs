To execute this program you have to:
	Set in the run script the desired variables
		- The Filename has to correlate with the file
		you want to process. If it's not in the same
		directory you have to adjust the name with the
		full path to the file.
		- Quantum
		- Context Switch Time
Or you start the program in e.g. Eclipse (or through console), where you add the parameters accordingly. 


If the given input file is not found, the program
creates one by itself.
If you want to make a new input file you enter "y"
while the program is running.
If you want to change the parameters for the creation
of the input file, open schedule_simulator.jar in WinRar
or a similar archiving program, head to schedule_Sim
and open InputCreatorSettings.txt
Make the desired adjustments and save it, update the .jar
and your good to go.



I'm aware, that it not completely fulfills the requirements as seen in the PDF file. It's not going to be updated any time soon.
